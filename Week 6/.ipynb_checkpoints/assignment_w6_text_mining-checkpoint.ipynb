With the bag-of-words model, certain words which are related to a positive (> 3 stars), neutral (3 stars) or negative review (< 3 stars), are categorized into 3 groups. Therefore, each \"bag-of-words\" contains words categorized by one of the 3 catgories (positive/neutral/negative). For example, the bag labelled as 3 stars or more should mostly include positive reviews, while the bag with less than 3 stars should mostly include neutral or negative words. \n",
